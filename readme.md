framework: a collection of libraries that provides a structure for developers to build upon. It is a foundation for building a software application.

Angular JS Vs React JS

Angular JS: AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.

React JS: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

Reasons for using React JS:

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- has a large community and a lot of support.
- Many modern web applications are built using React. Example: Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, WhatsApp, and many more.
- It is more preferred for streaming services, e-commerce, social media, and other applications that rely on a lot of data.

Website Vs Web Application

Website: A website is a collection of web pages that are linked together and can be accessed by visiting the homepage using a browser. It is a collection of static web pages that are designed to provide information to the user, such as college websites, news websites, blogs, and many more.

Web Application: A web application is a software application that runs on a web server and is accessed through a web browser. It is a dynamic website that provides interactive features to the user. It can be used to perform specific tasks, such as online banking, e-commerce, social media, and many more.
